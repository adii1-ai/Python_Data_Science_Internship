# =============

# Simple and Easy to Learn
# Python has a clear and readable syntax that looks similar to the English language. This makes it easy for beginners to understand and write programs with less effort.

# Interpreted Language
# Python is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed line by line. There is no need for compilation, which helps in quick testing and debugging.

# High-Level Language
# Python handles memory management automatically. The programmer does not need to worry about low-level details like memory allocation, which simplifies coding.

# Dynamically Typed
# In Python, you do not need to declare the data type of a variable. The interpreter automatically assigns the data type during execution.

# Object-Oriented Programming Support
# Python supports object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, which help in writing structured and reusable code.

# Large Standard Library
# Python provides a rich set of built-in libraries and modules for tasks like file handling, math operations, web development, and data analysis.

# Platform Independent
# Python programs can run on different operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS without any changes in the code.

# Open Source and Free
# Python is free to use and open source. Anyone can download, use, and modify Python without any cost.

# Supports Multiple Programming Paradigms
# Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles, allowing flexibility in writing programs.

# Extensive Community Support
# Python has a large global community. Beginners can easily find tutorials, documentation, and solutions to problems online.
